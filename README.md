# Script Glider
### Our project is aimed at creating an interactive game, that brings together the best of both the gaming worlds: Word games( for all the logophiles out there!) and the classic flappy bird concept, for the paradigmatic game lovers :)
### This game was made in Scribbler Platform and can be opened by this link : https://app.scribbler.live/#github:ShivaVarun-Adicherla/Script-Glider/Script_Glider.jsnb
#### Our game is built using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. To make the game more interesting an option to upload any PDF, that will be parsed, and 5 letter words be selected from it.
#### Game on!
#### Complete the word, to save your plane!
